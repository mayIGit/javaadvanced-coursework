/*
 * Instructions:
 *  
 * You have to create another class called MyBook(in this file) that extends the 
 * Book abstract class. 
 * Notice that setTitle method in the Book class is abstract and has no body. 
 * That means you must implement the body of this method in the child class.
 * In the editor, we have provided the abstract Book class and a Main class. 
 * In the Main class, we've created an instance of a class called MyBook. 
 * Your task is to write just the MyBook class.
 * Your class mustn't be public.
