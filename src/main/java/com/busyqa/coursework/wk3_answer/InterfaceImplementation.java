/*
 * Instructions:
 * 
 * You are given an interface AdvancedArithmetic that contains a method 
 * signature "int divisorSum(int n)". You need to write a class called 
 * Calculator which implements the interface. divisorSum function just takes 
 * an integer as input and return the sum of all its divisors. 
 * For example divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6, so divisorSum should return 12. 
 * The value of n will be at most 1000. Read the partially completed code in the 
 * editor and complete it. You just need to write the Calculator class only. 
 * Your class shouldn't be public.
 *
